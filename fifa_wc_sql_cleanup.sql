     Author: Daniel Vazquez
Description: The following scripts are used to clean up the tables obtained
             from data scrapping rosters and fixtures from FIFA World Cup
			 tournaments. It also serves as data exploration for stats from
			 previous tournaments.

			 Steps:
			   1. Data Cleaning
				  a. Create 'Age' field in FIFA_wc_players
				  b. Separate 'Captain' label from FIFA_wc_players
				  c. Replace 'Pos' data for the true position names in
				     FIFA_wc_players.
				  d. Separate goals in 'Result' field and add a new field for
				     match winner.
				  e. Add field to flag games that had a penalty kick round.
